<a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

</h1>

When assessing the multiple ecosystem services provided by German
forests, economic ecosystem services are relevant but not always easily
estimable as their calculation is complex requires many assumptions.
Especially for private forest owners, the expected monetary return
generated by wood production is of high interest as it provides the main
source of income for forest owners. The required net revenues for wood
depend, among others, on tree species, diameter, and wood quality. Also
disturbance events affect the returns, as wood quality is reduced due to
mechanical damage and and also the price is reduced due to market
effects [Fuchs et al. (under review)](#fuchs.underreview).

Here, <strong>woodValuationDE</strong> contributes with a comprehensive
wood valuation model considering the various influences on
<em>assortment configuration</em>, <em>harvest costs</em> and <em>wood
revenues</em>. It simplifies the estimation of realistic wood values for
broad field of bioeconomic applications. A particular strength of
<strong>woodValuationDE</strong> is the consistency of the data
underlying the various models, including a set of disturbance scenarios.

<strong>woodValuationDE</strong> comprises data and models obtained from
several studies, but which are consistent since
all<sup>[1](#fndieter),[2](#fnmoellmann)</sup> submodels are based on
operational harvest and sale data of HessenForst, the forest
administration of the Federal State of Hesse in Germany. The underlying
assortment tables are taken from [Offer and Staupendahl
(2018)](#offer.2018) with corresponding functions for salable and
skidded volume derived in [Fuchs et al. (in
preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation). Wood revenue and harvest cost
functions were taken from [von Bodelschwingh
(2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). The effects of calamities refer to
[Dieter (2001)](#dieter.2001)<sup>[1](#fndieter)</sup>, [Moellmann and
Moehring (2017)](#moellmann.2017)<sup>[2](#fnmoellmann)</sup>, [Fuchs et
al. (under review)](#fuchs.underreview), and [Fuchs et al. (in
preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation).

The assortment tables as well as the other models in
<strong>woodValuationDE</strong> represent average conditions in Hesse.
Thus, the estimations usually represent a strong simplification, since
the variability of these values is very large in practice. Furthermore,
the assortment tables assume the harvest of entire stands, which must be
considered when only harvests of smaller parts of stands are estimated.
We thus recommend the application mainly for harvests of larger parts of stands or
entire stands and encourage users to conduct sensitivity analyses and to
review the default and modify them where necessary.

<i><sup><a id="fndieter">1</a></sup>The assumed factor according to
[Dieter (2001)](#dieter.2001) is an exception since it is based on wood
prices in southern Germany. However, we included it since it has often
been applied in bioeconomic simulations for Germany.</i>

<i><sup><a id="fndieter">1</a></sup>The assumed factors according to
[Moellmann and Moehring (2017)](#moellmann.2017) are an exception since
they are based surveys of entire Germany. However, we included them,
since they provide estimates distinguishing between the disturbances
agents.</i>

The wood valuation implemented in <strong>woodValuationDE</strong> is a
three-stage approach, deriving (i) the relevant volume shares, (ii) the
revenues and costs per volume unit, and (iii) the net revenues (see Fig.
1).

<br> We assume that the wood value to be estimated regards standing
trees. Thus, volume losses due to harvest cuts and not using e.g. the
entire stem will occur. For the valuation,
<a href="#fct_vol_salable"><em>vol_salable</em></a> provides the share
of salable wood volume, i.e. the volume that is utilized and taken out
of the forest stand. Only this volume share is relevant for the
revenues. <a href="#fct_vol_skidded"><em>vol_skidded</em></a> provides
the skidded volume which is brought to the forest road. It is relevant
for remuneration for the harvest, i.e. the harvest costs. The salable
volume is higher as the skidded volume since it includes the private
fuelwood usage.

Accordingly, <a href="#fct_wood_revenues"><em>wood_revenues</em></a>
estimates the revenues per unit volume of salable wood \[EUR
m<sup>-3</sup>\] and
<a href="#fct_harvest_costs"><em>harvest_costs</em></a> the harvest
costs per unit volume of skidded wood \[EUR m<sup>-3</sup>\]. Both
models depend on the tree species and mean diameter
at breast height (dbh) of the tree. The dbh is typically measured as the quadratic mean. Arithmetic means, however, are also suitable. Further parameters are the average trunk quality in the stand, the
type of harvest, and the accessibility of the stand for harvest
operations. In addition, current market situations can be considered via
a price correction.

The functions <a href="fct_wood_valuation"><em>wood_valuation</em></a>
and <a href="fct_wood_net_revenues"><em>wood_net_revenues</em></a>
provide wrappers for easily applying the wood valuation procedure
implemented in <strong>woodValuationDE</strong>. Both functions call the
previously described ones and combine them to derive the net wood
revenues. While <a href="fct_wood_valuation"><em>wood_valuation</em></a>
returns a tibble with the entire calculations,
<a href="fct_wood_net_revenues"><em>wood_net_revenues</em></a> can be
used to directly get the total net revenues \[EUR\].

In the next section, we describe the functions input and output as well
as the underlying models and data with their references in more detail.
The parameters for all models are stored as internal object
<em>params.wood.value</em>. Users interested in the detailed parameters
can call them via:
# Hier ist mir nicht ganz klar was mit parameters gemeint ist. Heißt das, dass der modell Output der einen Funktion in ein Objekt gespeichert wird, um ihn für die folgende Funktion zu strukturieren? Dann würde ich es etwas umformulieren. Sag einfach Bescheid, ich übernehme das.

The function estimates the share of standing wood volume which is
salable. This includes e.g. pulpwood, sawlogs, but also private
fuelwood. Thus, it represents the entire share of wood which is taken out of
the forest for usage. The share of salable wood is required to derive
the wood revenues per unit standing volume. The function is based on the
assortment tables of [Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and its
derivation is described in [Fuchs et al. (in
preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation). The underlying assortment tables
are based on data of HessenForst, the forest administration of the
Federal State of Hesse in Germany.

<h3>

Data and Model

</h3>

The assortment tables of [Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018)
provide the total share of the standing trees' volume which is
harvested. In addition, they provide the share of non-utilized wood and
private fuelwood thereof. The assortment tables were derived for
HessenForst with the calculation program Holzernte 7.1 [(Schöpfer et
al., 2003)](#schopfer.2003) using model stands, which were designed by a
group of forestry experts, and harvest and sale data of HessenForst.
More details on the assortment tables and their derivation are provided
in [Offer and Staupendahl (2008)](#offer.2008) and [Offer and
Staupendahl (2009)](#offer.2009).

Based on the assortment tables, we derived the salable volume share of
the standing trees. Since the assortment tables only provide the values
in diameter steps of 2 cm, a Gompertz functions was fitted in order to
have a continuous model (see [Fuchs et al., in
preparation](#fuchs.inpreparation)). For the model fitting, the modified
formulation according to [Fischer and Schoenfelder
(2017)](#fischer.2017) was used:

<p align="center">

<i>v<sub>salable</sub></i> = <i>$\alpha$</i> \* exp( -exp(
<i>$\beta$</i> / <i>$\alpha$</i> \* exp(1) \* (<i>$\gamma$</i> -
<i>d<sub>q</sub></i>))),

</p>

with the volume share of salable wood <i>v<sub>salable</sub></i>, the
quadratic mean diameter <i>d<sub>q</sub></i> and the parameters
<i>$\alpha$</i>, <i>$\beta$</i> and <i>$\gamma$</i>. This formulation
provides parameters that are easier to interpret, and simplifies the
choice of starting values.

Stand quality expressed as integer value of 1:3:

<ul>

<li>

<i>1</i>: extraordinary high stand quality with high shares of wood
suitable for furniture

</li>

<li>

<i>2</i>: average quality

</li>

<li>

<i>3</i>: extraordinary low quality (e.g. trees with many thick branches
or stands with massive ungulate damages)

</li>

</ul>

The <i>value.levels</i> refer to the applied assortment tables [(Offer
and Staupendahl, 2018)](#offer.2018).

<h4>

<i>process.type</i>

</h4>

Type of harvest process:

<ul>

<li>

<i>"manually"</i>: motor-manual harvest using a chain saw

</li>

<li>

</li>

<li>

<i>"combined"</i>: a combination of the previous types dependent on the
mean diameter.

</li>

The process types "manually" and "harvester" refer to [Offer and
Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and [von Bodelschwingh
(2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Since e.g. for deciduous species a
maximum diameter of 40 cm is assumed for highly mechanized harvests,
[Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation) derived the type
<i>"combined"</i>. This refers to the combinations applied by [von
Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018) in the harvest cost model,
assuming diameter-specific shares of motor-manual and highly mechanized
harvests:

<ul>

<em><a name="fct_vol_skidded">vol_skidded</a></em>

</h2>

The function estimates the share of standing wood volume which is
skidded. This is the share of salable volume, but excluding private fuel
wood since this is not commercially skidded. The share of skidded wood
is required to derive the harvest costs per unit standing volume. The
function is based on the assortment tables of [Offer and Staupendahl
(2018)](#offer.2018) and its derivation is described in [Fuchs et al.
(in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation). The underlying assortment
tables are based on data of HessenForst, the forest administration of
the Federal State of Hesse in Germany.

<h2>

<em><a name="fct_wood_revenues">wood_revenues</a></em>

</h2>

The function estimates wood revenues per unit salable volume based on
the assortment tables of [Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and
the wood revenue function of [von Bodelschwingh
(2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Consequences of calamities are
implemented based on [Dieter (2001)](#dieter.2001), [Moellmann and
Moehring (2017)](#moellmann.2017), [Fuchs et al. (under
review)](#fuchs.underreview) and [Fuchs et al. (in

(2001)](#dieter.2001) and [Moellmann and Moehring
(2017)](#moellmann.2017), the function and all factors are based on data
of HessenForst, the forest administration of the Federal State of Hesse
in Germany.

<h3>

Data and Model

</h3>

The diameter- and species-sensitive wood revenue model was developed by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). It is based on a
previous version (2013) of the assortment tables of [Offer and
Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and the wood sales of HessenForst from
2010 to 2015. A price matrix for different assortments was derived out
of the sales data and combined with the assortment table to derive mean
wood revenues over all assortments. The fitted model function is:

<p align="center">

<i>s</i> = <i>$\alpha$</i> \* <i>d<sub>q</sub></i><sup>4</sup> +
<i>$\beta$</i> \* <i>d<sub>q</sub></i><sup>3</sup> + <i>$\gamma$</i> \*
<i>d<sub>q</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + <i>$\delta$</i> \*
<i>d<sub>q</sub></i> + <i>$\epsilon$</i>,

</p>

with the quadratic mean diameter <i>d<sub>q</sub></i> and the parameters
<i>$\alpha$</i> to <i>$\epsilon$</i>.

The model estimates wood revenues for the time period 2010 to 2015. Via
the market price of a reference assortment for each species, this can be
adapted to other years. The references assortments (saw wood) are
defined by diameter class (1: 10-19 cm, 2: 20-29..., with 1a: 10-14 cm
and 1b: 15-19 cm) and quality of A to D (with A the highest and D the
lowest quality) as usually applied in Germany (see [Deutscher
Forstwirtschaftsrat and Deutscher Holzwirtschaftsrat,
2020](#deutscherforstwirtschaftsrat.2020)). The original prices of the
reference assortments <i>p<sub>reference.assortment,original</sub></i>
in Hesse between 2010 and 2015 are listed in <a href="#tab12">Tab.
2</a>. If another price <i>p<sub>reference.assortment,user</sub></i> is
applied to <a href="#fct_wood_revenues"><em>wood_revenues</em></a> the
baseline wood revenues of the model <i>s<sub>original</sub></i> will be
adapted (<i>s<sub>adapted</sub></i>) by:

A particular strength of <strong>woodValuationDE</strong> is the
consideration of consequences of calamities. A broad set of previously
published and newly derived quantitative effects of calamities is
implemented. Additionally, user can implement their own assumed factors. For
wood revenues, a calamity factor is multiplied with the undisturbed
revenues. The options that are implemented by default are listed in
<a href="#tab3">Tab. 3</a>.

<h3>

Input

</h3>

Apart from <i>species.code.type</i>, <i>price.ref.assortment</i>, and
<i>calamity.factors</i>, all user inputs can be provided as single
values or as a vector. If mixed, the single values will be recycled.

<h4>

<i>diameter.q</i>

</h4>

The quadratic mean of the diameter at breast height (dbh) of the
harvested trees \[cm\].

<h4>

<i>species</i>

</h4>

The tree species, using an available <i>species.code.type</i>.
<a href="#tab1">Tab. 1</a> lists the most important genera and species
implemented. Most species are assigned to economic species groups for
the valuation. A list of available species, codes, and their assignments
to valuation groups is provided by:

``` r
get_species_codes()
```

<h4>

<i>value.level</i>

</h4>

Stand quality expressed as integer value of 1:3:

<ul>

<li>

<i>1</i>: extraordinary high stand quality with high shares of wood
suitable for furniture

</li>

<li>

<i>2</i>: average quality

</li>

<li>

<i>3</i>: extraordinary low quality (e.g. trees with many thick branches
or stands with massive ungulate damages)

</li>

</ul>

The <i>value.levels</i> refer to the applied assortment tables [(Offer
and Staupendahl, 2018)](#offer.2018).

<h4>

<i>process.type</i>

</h4>

Type of harvest process:

<ul>

<li>

<i>"manually"</i>: motor-manual harvest using a chain saw

</li>

<li>

<i>"harvester"</i>: highly mechanized harvest machines

</li>

<li>

<i>"combined"</i>: a combination of the previous types dependent on the
mean diameter.

</li>

</ul>

The process types "manually" and "harvester" refer to [Offer and
Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and [von Bodelschwingh
(2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Since e.g. for deciduous species a
maximum diameter of 40 cm is assumed for highly mechanized harvests,
[Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation) derived the type
<i>"combined"</i>. This refers to the combinations applied by [von
Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018) in the harvest cost model,
assuming diameter-specific shares of motor-manual and highly mechanized
harvests:

<ul>

<li>

softwood species

</li>

<ul>

<li>

<i>diameter.q</i> ≤ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,

</li>

<li>

20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 50 cm: linear increase of
<i>"manually"</i>, maximum 50 %,

</li>

<li>

diameter.q</i> ≥ 50 cm: 50 % <i>"harvester"</i> and 50 %
<i>"manually"</i>.

</ul>

<li>

deciduous species

</li>

<ul>

<li>

<i>diameter.q</i> ≤ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,

</li>

<li>

20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 40 cm: linear increase of
<i>"manually"</i>, maximum 100 %,

</li>

<li>

diameter.q</i> ≥ 40 cm: 100 % <i>"manually"</i>.

</ul>

</ul>

<h4>

<i>price.ref.assortment</i>

</h4>

Wood price of the reference assortments allowing to consider market
fluctuations as described above. Default is <i>"baseline"</i> referring
to the prices from 2010 to 2015 in Hesse, Germany according to [von
Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018), listed in
<a href="#tab2">Tab. 2</a>. Alternatively, it can be user-provided
tibble with the same structure, illustrated by the default tibble:

``` r
prices.ref.assortments <- dplyr::tibble(
      species = c(110, 211, 511, 711, 611,
                  811, 410, 421, 311, 430),
      price.ref.assortment = c(277.41, 75.75, 92.47, 71.48, 92.23,
                               83.29, 72.13, 98.90, 112.88, 45.43))
```

<h4>

<i>calamity.type</i>

</h4>

Type of a potential calamity determining the applied calamity
corrections, which implement reduced returns (and higher harvest costs).
For the implemented options described above see <a href="#tab3">Tab.
3</a>. Alternatively, users can provide their own factors.

<h4>

<i>calamity.factors</i>

</h4>

Summands \[EUR m<sup>-3</sup>\] and factors to consider the consequences
of calamities on wood revenues and harvest costs. <i>"baseline"</i>
provides a tibble based on the references listed in <a href="#tab5">Tab.
5</a>. Alternatively, users can provide an own tibble with the same
structure, illustrated by the default tibble:

<h2>

<em><a name="fct_harvest_costs">harvest_costs</a></em>

</h2>

The function estimates harvest costs per unit skidded wood volume
applying the harvest costs function of [von Bodelschwingh
(2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Consequences of calamities are
implemented based on [Dieter (2001)](#dieter.2001), [Moellmann and
Moehring (2017)](#moellmann.2017), [Fuchs et al. (under
review)](#fuchs.underreview), and [Fuchs et al. (in
preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation).

<h3>

Data and Model

</h3>

The diameter- and species-sensitive harvest cost model was developed by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). It is based on data
from [KWF (2006)](#kwf.2006) and [AFL (2014)](#afl.2014). The fitted
model function is:

<p align="center">

<i>c</i> = max(<i>$\alpha$</i> \*
<i>d<sub>q</sub></i><sup><i>$\beta$</i></sup> + <i>$\gamma$</i>,
<i>c<sub>max</sub></i>),

</p>

with the quadratic mean diameter <i>d<sub>q</sub></i> and the parameters
<i>$\alpha$</i> to <i>$\gamma$</i> and the maximum costs
<i>c<sub>max</sub></i>. The harvest costs were derived for a smaller
number of species groups, thus, the species assignments differ from
those for <a href="#fct_wood_revenues"><em>wood_revenues</em></a>. The
species assignments are provided by:

``` r
get_species_codes()
```

The harvest costs are calculated under the assumption of combinations of
harvest processes, depended on the quadratic mean of the tree diameters
as well as the accessibility of the stand. The accessibility considers
is considered in three cost levels (see <a href="#tab4">Tab. 4</a>). To
avoid unusually high harvest costs at smaller diameters, [von
Bodelschwingh (2018, Tab. 10)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018) defined maximum
harvest costs <i>c<sub>max</sub></i> (see <a href="#tab4">Tab. 4</a>).

A special strength of <strong>woodValuationDE</strong> is the
consideration of consequences of calamities. A broad set of previously
published and newly derived quantitative effects of calamities is
implemented. Additionally, user can implement their own factors. For the
harvest costs, multiplicative factors as well as absolute summands can
be used for implementing consequences of disturbances. The options that
are implemented by default are listed in <a href="#tab5">Tab. 5</a>.

<h3>

Input

</h3>

Apart from <i>species.code.type</i>, <i>price.ref.assortment</i>, and
<i>calamity.factors</i>, all user inputs can be provided as single
values or as a vector. If mixed, the single values will be recycled.

<h4>

<i>diameter.q</i>

</h4>

The quadratic mean of the diameter at breast height (dbh) of the
harvested trees \[cm\].

<h4>

<i>species</i>

</h4>

The tree species, using an available <i>species.code.type</i>.
<a href="#tab1">Tab. 1</a> lists the most important genera and species
implemented. Most species are assigned to economic species groups for
the valuation. A list of available species, codes, and their assignments
to valuation groups is provided by:

``` r
get_species_codes()
```

<h4>

<i>cost.level</i>

</h4>

Accessibility of the stand for harvest operations expressed as integer
of 1:3, with 1 for standard conditions without limitations, 2 for moist
sites or sites with a slope between 36 % and 58 %, and 3 for slopes \>
58 %. The cost.levels refer to the harvest cost model by [von
Bodelschwingh (2018, Tab. 10)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). See also
<a href="#tab4">Tab. 4</a>

<h4>

<i>calamity.type</i>

</h4>

Type of a potential calamity determining the applied calamity
corrections, which implement higher harvest costs (and reduced returns).
For the implemented options described above see <a href="#tab5">Tab.
5</a>. Alternatively, users can provide their own factors.

<h4>

<i>calamity.factors</i>

</h4>

Summands \[EUR m<sup>-3</sup>\] and factors to consider the consequences
of calamities on wood revenues and harvest costs. <i>"baseline"</i>
provides a tibble based on the references listed in <a href="#tab5">Tab.
5</a>. Alternatively, users can provide an own tibble with the same
structure, illustrated by the default tibble:

<h2>

<em><a name="fct_wood_valuation">wood_valuation</a></em>

</h2>

The function is a wrapper for the entire procedure of wood valuation
provided by <strong>woodValuationDE</strong>. It estimates the share of
salable (for revenues) and skidded (for harvest costs) volume as well as
the wood revenues and harvest costs. Finally, it derives the net
revenues for the user-provided standing wood volume.

<h3>

Data and Model

</h3>

The function applies the previously described models implemented in the
functions <a href="#fct_vol_salable"><i>vol_salable</i></a>,
<a href="#fct_vol_skidded"><i>vol_skidded</i></a>,
<a href="#fct_wood_revenues"><i>wood_revenues</i></a>, and
<a href="#fct_harvest_costs"><i>harvest_costs</i></a>.

<h3>

Input

</h3>

<h4>

<i>volume</i>

</h4>

Wood volume \[m<sup>3</sup>\], referring to standing tree volume before
the harvest.

<h4>

<i>diameter.q</i>

</h4>

The quadratic mean of the diameter at breast height (dbh) of the
harvested trees \[cm\].

<h4>

<i>species</i>

</h4>

The tree species, using an available <i>species.code.type</i>.
<a href="#tab1">Tab. 1</a> lists the most important genera and species
implemented. Most species are assigned to economic species groups for
the valuation. A list of available species, codes, and their assignments
to valuation groups is provided by:

``` r
get_species_codes()
```

<h4>

<i>value.level</i>

</h4>

Stand quality expressed as integer value of 1:3:

<ul>

<li>

<i>1</i>: extraordinary high stand quality with high shares of wood
suitable for furniture

</li>

<li>

<i>2</i>: average quality

</li>

<li>

<i>3</i>: extraordinary low quality (e.g. trees with many thick branches
or stands with massive ungulate damages)

</li>

</ul>

The <i>value.levels</i> refer to the applied assortment tables [(Offer
and Staupendahl, 2018)](#offer.2018).

<h4>

<i>cost.level</i>

</h4>

Accessibility of the stand for harvest operations expressed as integer
of 1:3, with 1 for standard conditions without limitations, 2 for moist
sites or sites with a slope between 36 % and 58 %, and 3 for slopes \>
58 %. The cost.levels refer to the harvest cost model by [von
Bodelschwingh (2018, Tab. 10)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). See also
<a href="#tab4">Tab. 4</a>

<h4>

<i>process.type</i>

</h4>

Type of harvest process:

<ul>

<li>

<i>"manually"</i>: motor-manual harvest using a chain saw

</li>

<li>

<i>"harvester"</i>: highly mechanized harvest machines

</li>

<li>

<i>"combined"</i>: a combination of the previous types dependent on the
mean diameter.

</li>

</ul>

The process types "manually" and "harvester" refer to [Offer and
Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and [von Bodelschwingh
(2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Since e.g. for deciduous species a
maximum diameter of 40 cm is assumed for highly mechanized harvests,
[Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation) derived the type
<i>"combined"</i>. This refers to the combinations applied by [von
Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018) in the harvest cost model,
assuming diameter-specific shares of motor-manual and highly mechanized
harvests:

<ul>

<li>

softwood species

</li>

<ul>

<li>

<i>diameter.q</i> ≤ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,

</li>

<li>

20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 50 cm: linear increase of
<i>"manually"</i>, maximum 50 %,

</li>

<li>

diameter.q</i> ≥ 50 cm: 50 % <i>"harvester"</i> and 50 %
<i>"manually"</i>.

</ul>

<li>

deciduous species

</li>

<ul>

<li>

<i>diameter.q</i> ≤ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,

</li>

<li>

20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 40 cm: linear increase of
<i>"manually"</i>, maximum 100 %,

</li>

<li>

diameter.q</i> ≥ 40 cm: 100 % <i>"manually"</i>.

</ul>

</ul>
