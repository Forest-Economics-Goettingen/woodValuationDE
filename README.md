woodValuationDE
===================================

A package for monetary valuation of wood in Germany forests, including
estimations of the harvest volume proportions, wood revenues and harvest
costs. The functions are sensitive to tree species, mean diameter of the
harvested trees, stand quality and harvest procedure. The functions
include estimations for the consequences of disturbances on revenues and
costs.

<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>

When assessing the multiple ecosystem services provided by German
forests, economic indicators for productive ecosystem services are
relevant but not always easily estimable as their calculation is time
consuming and requires many quantitative information or assumption on
them. The net wood revenues, as basis for several indicators related to
income from wood production, depend, a.o., on tree species, diameter,
and stand quality. Also disturbance events affect the net revenues, as
wood quality is reduced due to mechanical damage, market prices are
reduced due to increasing wood supply and harvest costs might increase
[Fuchs et al. (under review)](#fuchs.underreview).

Here, <strong>woodValuationDE</strong> contributes with a comprehensive
wood valuation model considering the various influences on 
<em>assortment composition</em>, <em>harvest costs</em> and <em>wood
revenues</em>. It simplifies the estimation of realistic wood values for
broad field of bioeconomic applications. A particular strength of
<strong>woodValuationDE</strong> is the consistency of the data
underlying the various models, including a set of disturbance scenarios.

<strong>woodValuationDE</strong> comprises data and models obtained from
several studies. It thus makes previously published models available for
future studies by creating a consistent valuation framework since
all<sup>[1](#fndieter),[2](#fnmoellmann)</sup> submodels are based on
operational harvest and sale data of HessenForst, the public forest
service of the Federal State of Hesse in Germany. The underlying
assortment tables are taken from [Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](
#offer.2018) with corresponding functions for the harvest volume
proportions derived in [Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](
#fuchs.inpreparation). Wood revenue and harvest cost functions were
taken from [von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). The 
consequences of disturbances refer to [Dieter (2001)](
#dieter.2001)<sup>[1](#fndieter)</sup>, [Moellmann and Moehring (2017)](
#moellmann.2017)<sup>[2](#fnmoellmann)</sup>, [Fuchs et al. (2021)](
#fuchs.2021), and [Fuchs et al. (under review)](#fuchs.underreview).

The assortment tables as well as the other models in
<strong>woodValuationDE</strong> represent average conditions in Hesse.
Thus, the estimations usually represent a strong simplification, since
the variability of these values is very large in practice. Furthermore,
the assortment tables assume the harvest of entire stands, which must be
considered when revenues for harvests of smaller parts of stands are
estimated. We thus recommend the application mainly for harvests of
larger parts of stands or entire stands. We encourage users to conduct
sensitivity analyses and to review the default parameters and modify
them where necessary.

<i><sup><a id="fndieter">1</a></sup>The assumed factor according to
[Dieter (2001)](#dieter.2001) is an exception since it is based on wood
prices in southern Germany. However, we included it since it has often
been applied in bioeconomic simulations for Germany.</i>

<i><sup><a id="fndieter">2</a></sup>The assumed factors according to
[Moellmann and Moehring (2017)](#moellmann.2017) are an exception since
they are based surveys of forest owners and managers in entire Germany.
However, we included them, since they provide estimates distinguishing
between the disturbances agents.</i>

<h1><a name="structure">Package Structure</a></h1>

The wood valuation implemented in <strong>woodValuationDE</strong> is a
three-stage approach, deriving (i) the relevant harvest volume
proportions, (ii) the revenues and costs per volume unit, and (iii) the
net revenues (see Fig. 1).

</figure>

<br><strong>woodValuationDE</strong> allows for estimating the wood
value referring to the volume of the standing trees. Volume losses
due to harvest cuts and residuals, e.g. due to fixed assortment length,
are applied based on the harvest volume proportion functions:
<a href="#fct_vol_salable"><em>vol_salable()</em></a> provides the 
share of salable volume relative to the volume over bark of the standing
trees that are to be harvested. It represents the volume that is
utilized and taken out of the forest stand and is the relevant volume
unit for the revenues.
<a href="#fct_vol_skidded"><em>vol_skidded()</em></a> provides
the share of skidded volume relative to the volume over bark of th
standing trees that are to be harvested. This volume share is brought
to the forest road and represents the relevant volume unit for
remuneration for the harvest, i.e. the harvest costs. The salable volume
is higher than the skidded volume since it also includes the private
fuelwood usage, which is not commercially skidded.

Accordingly, <a href="#fct_wood_revenues"><em>wood_revenues()</em></a>
estimates the revenues per unit volume of salable wood [EUR
m<sup>-3</sup>] and
<a href="#fct_harvest_costs"><em>harvest_costs()</em></a> the harvest
costs per unit volume of skidded wood [EUR m<sup>-3</sup>]. Both
models depend on the tree species and mean
diameter<sup>[3](#fndq)</sup> of the harvested trees. Further function
arguments are the stand quality, the type of harvest procedure, and the
accessibility of the stand for harvest operations. In addition, current
market situations can be considered via updated prices for the German
reference assortments.

The functions <a href="fct_wood_valuation"><em>wood_valuation()</em></a>
and <a href="fct_wood_net_revenues"><em>wood_net_revenues()</em></a>
provide wrappers for easily applying the wood valuation procedure
implemented in <strong>woodValuationDE</strong>. Both functions call the
previously described ones and combine them to derive the net wood
revenues. While <a href="fct_wood_valuation"><em>wood_valuation()</em>
</a> returns a tibble with the entire calculations,
<a href="fct_wood_net_revenues"><em>wood_net_revenues()</em></a> can be
used to directly get the total net revenues [EUR].

In the next section, we describe the functions' input arguments and
output values as well as the underlying models and data with their
references in more detail. The parameters for all models are stored as
internal object <em>params.wood.value</em>. Users interested in the
detailed parameters can call them via:

``` r
woodValuationDE:::params.wood.value
```

<i><sup><a id="fndq">3</a></sup>The mean diameter is calculated as the
diameter corresponding to the mean single-tree basal area (at breast
height) of the harvested trees, often referred to as QMD, D<sub>q</sub>,
or D<sub>g</sub> (see e.g. [Curtis and Mashall (2000)](#curtis.2000))
</i>

<h1><a name="functions">Functions, Models, and Underlying Data</a></h1>

<h2><em><a name="fct_vol_salable">vol_salable()</a></em></h2>

The function estimates the salable share of the volume over bark of the
standing trees that are to be harvested. This includes e.g. pulpwood,
sawlogs, but also private fuelwood. Thus, it represents the entire share
of wood which is taken out of the forest for usage. The share of salable
wood is required to  derive the wood revenues per unit standing volume.
The function is based on the assortment tables of
[Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and its derivation is
described in [Fuchs et al. (inpreparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation). The
underlying assortment tables are based on data of HessenForst, the
public forest service of the Federal State of Hesse in Germany.

<h3>Data and Model</h3>

The assortment tables of [Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018)
provide conversion factors from the volume of standing trees over bark
to the harvested volume under bark. In addition, they provide the share
of non-utilized wood, e.g. due to fixed assortment lengths, and private
fuelwood thereof. The assortment tables were derived for HessenForst
with the calculation program Holzernte 7.1
[(Sch√∂pfer et al., 2003)](#schopfer.2003) using model stands, which were
designed by a group of forestry experts, and harvest and sale data of
HessenForst. More details on the assortment tables and their derivation
are provided in [Offer and Staupendahl (2008)](#offer.2008) and
[Offer and Staupendahl (2009)](#offer.2009).

We derived the share of salable volume based on these assortment tables.
Since the assortment tables only provide the values in diameter
steps of 2 cm, a Gompertz function was fitted in order to have a
continuous model (see
[Fuchs et al., in preparation](#fuchs.inpreparation)). For the model
fitting, the modified formulation according to
[Fischer and Schoenfelder (2017)](#fischer.2017) was used:

<p align="center">
  <i>v<sub>salable</sub></i> = <i>$\alpha$</i> \* exp( -exp(
  <i>$\beta$</i> / <i>$\alpha$</i> \* exp(1) \* (<i>$\gamma$</i> -
  <i>d<sub>q</sub></i>))),
</p>

with the volume share of salable wood <i>v<sub>salable</sub></i>, the
quadratic mean diameter <i>d<sub>q</sub></i> and the parameters
<i>$\alpha$</i>, <i>$\beta$</i> and <i>$\gamma$</i>.

<h3>Input</h3>

Apart from <i>species.code.type</i>, all user inputs can be provided as
single values or as a vector. If mixed, the single values will be
recycled.

<h4><i>value.level</i></h4>

Stand quality, expressed as integer value of 1:3:

<ul>
  <li>
    <i>1</i>: extraordinary high stand quality with high shares of wood
    suitable for furniture
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>2</i>: average quality
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>3</i>: extraordinary low quality (e.g. trees with many thick
    branches)
  </li>
</ul>

The <i>value.levels</i> refer to the applied assortment tables
[(Offer and Staupendahl, 2018)](#offer.2018).

<h4><i>process.type</i></h4>

Type of harvest process:

<ul>
  <li>
    <i>"manually"</i>: motor-manual harvest using a chain saw
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"harvester"</i>: highly mechanized harvest machines
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"combined"</i>: a combination of the previous types dependent on
    the mean diameter.
  </li>
</ul>

The process types <i>"manually"</i> and <i>"harvester"</i> refer to
[Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Since e.g. for
deciduous species a maximum diameter of 40 cm is assumed for highly
mechanized harvests,
[Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation) derived the type
<i>"combined"</i>. This refers to the combinations applied by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018) in the harvest cost
model, assuming diameter-specific shares of motor-manual and highly
mechanized harvests:

<ul>
  <li>
    softwood species
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>diameter.q</i> ‚â§ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,

    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4><i>species.code.type</i></h4>

The type of code in which <i>species</i> is given.

<ul>
  <li>
    <i>"en"</i>: English species names
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"nds"</i>: numeric species codes used in Lower Saxony, Germany.
  </li>

<h2><em><a name="fct_vol_skidded">vol_skidded()</a></em></h2>

The function estimates the skidded share of the volume over bark of the
standing trees that are to be harvested. It is the share of salable
volume, but excluding private fuel wood since this is not commercially
skidded. The share of skidded wood is required to derive the harvest
costs per unit standing volume. The function is based on the assortment
tables of [Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and its derivation
is described in [Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation).
The underlying assortment tables are based on data of HessenForst, the
public forest service of the Federal State of Hesse in Germany.

<h3>Data and Model</h3>

The assortment tables of
[Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) provide conversion factors
from the volume of standing trees over bark to the harvested volume
under bark. In addition, they provide the share of non-utilized wood,
e.g. due to fixed assortment lengths, and private fuelwood thereof. The
assortment tables were derived for HessenForst with the calculation
program Holzernte 7.1 [(Sch√∂pfer et al., 2003)](#schopfer.2003) using
model stands, which were designed by a group of forestry experts, and
harvest and sale data of HessenForst. More details on the assortment
tables and their derivation are provided in
[Offer and Staupendahl (2008)](#offer.2008) and
[Offer and Staupendahl (2009)](#offer.2009).

We derived the share of skidded volume based on these assortment tables.
Since the assortment tables only provide the values in diameter steps of
2 cm, a Gompertz functions was fitted in order to have a continuous
model (see [Fuchs et al., in preparation](#fuchs.inpreparation)). For
the model fitting, the modified formulation according to
[Fischer and Schoenfelder (2017)](#fischer.2017) was used:

<p align="center">
  <i>v<sub>skidded</sub></i> = <i>$\alpha$</i> \* exp( -exp(

<h2><em><a name="fct_wood_revenues">wood_revenues()</a></em></h2>

The function estimates average wood revenues per unit salable volume
[EUR m<sup>-3</sup>] based on the assortment tables of
[Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and the wood revenue
function of [von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018).
Consequences of calamities are implemented based on
[Dieter (2001)](#dieter.2001),
[Moellmann and Moehring (2017)](#moellmann.2017),
[Fuchs et al. (2021)](#fuchs.2021) and
[Fuchs et al. (under review)](#fuchs.underreview). Apart from
[Dieter (2001)](#dieter.2001) and
[Moellmann and Moehring (2017)](#moellmann.2017), the function and all
factors are based on data of HessenForst, the public forest service of
the Federal State of Hesse in Germany

<h3>Data and Model</h3>

The diameter- and species-sensitive wood revenue model was developed by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). It is based on a
previous version (2013) of the assortment tables of
[Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and the wood sales of
HessenForst from 2010 to 2015. A price matrix for different assortments
was derived out of the sales data and combined with the assortment table
to derive average wood revenues for diameter-dependent assortment
compositions. The fitted model function is:

<p align="center">
  <i>s</i> = <i>$\alpha$</i> \* <i>d<sub>q</sub></i><sup>4</sup> +
  <i>$\beta$</i> \* <i>d<sub>q</sub></i><sup>3</sup> + <i>$\gamma$</i> \*
  <i>d<sub>q</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + <i>$\delta$</i> \*
  <i>d<sub>q</sub></i> + <i>$\epsilon$</i>,
</p>

with the quadratic mean diameter <i>d<sub>q</sub></i> and the parameters
<i>$\alpha$</i> to <i>$\epsilon$</i>.

The model estimates wood revenues referring to Hessian market conditions
in the time period 2010 to 2015. Via the market price of a reference
assortment for each species, this can be adapted to other market
conditions. The references assortments (saw wood) are defined by
diameter class (1: 10-19 cm, 2: 20-29..., with 1a: 10-14 cm and 1b:
15-19 cm) and quality of A to D (with A the highest and
D the lowest quality) as usually applied in Germany (see
[Deutscher Forstwirtschaftsrat and Deutscher Holzwirtschaftsrat, 2020](#deutscherforstwirtschaftsrat.2020)).
The original prices of the reference assortments

A particular strength of <strong>woodValuationDE</strong> is the
consideration of consequences of calamities. A broad set of previously
published and often applied estimates for the consequences of
disturbances is implemented. Additionally, users can implement their own
assumptions. For wood revenues, a factor is multiplied with the
undisturbed revenues. The options that are implemented by default are
listed in <a href="#tab3">Tab. 3</a>.

<h3>Input</h3>

Apart from <i>species.code.type</i>, <i>price.ref.assortment</i>, and
<i>calamity.factors</i>, all user inputs can be provided as single
values or as a vector. If mixed, the single values will be recycled.

<h4><i>diameter.q</i></h4>

The quadratic mean<sup>[3](#fndq)</sup> of the diameter at breast height
(dbh) of the harvested trees [cm].

<h4><i>species</i></h4>

The tree species, using one of the available <i>species.code.type</i>s.
<a href="#tab1">Tab. 1</a> lists the most important genera and species
implemented. Most species are assigned to economic species groups for
the valuation. A list of available species codes, and their assignments
to valuation groups is provided by:
      
``` r
get_species_codes()
```

<h4><i>value.level</i></h4>

Stand quality, expressed as integer value of 1:3:
      
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>1</i>: extraordinary high stand quality with high shares of wood
    suitable for furniture
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>2</i>: average quality
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>3</i>: extraordinary low quality (e.g. trees with many thick
    branches)
  </li>
</ul>
      
The <i>value.levels</i> refer to the applied assortment tables
[(Offer and Staupendahl, 2018)](#offer.2018).

<h4><i>process.type</i></h4>

Type of harvest process:
    
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>"manually"</i>: motor-manual harvest using a chain saw
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"harvester"</i>: highly mechanized harvest machines
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"combined"</i>: a combination of the previous types dependent on
    the mean diameter.
  </li>
</ul>
      
The process types <i>"manually"</i> and <i>"harvester"</i> refer to
[Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Since e.g. for
deciduous species a maximum diameter of 40 cm is assumed for highly
mechanized harvests,
[Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation) derived the type
<i>"combined"</i>. This refers to the combinations applied by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018) in the harvest cost
model, assuming diameter-specific shares of motor-manual and highly
mechanized harvests:
                
<ul>
  <li>
    softwood species
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>diameter.q</i> ‚â§ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,
    </li>
    <li>
      20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 50 cm: linear increase of
      <i>"manually"</i>, maximum 50 %,
    </li>
    <li>
      diameter.q</i> ‚â• 50 cm: 50 % <i>"harvester"</i> and 50 %
      <i>"manually"</i>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    deciduous species
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>diameter.q</i> ‚â§ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,
    </li>
    <li>
      20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 40 cm: linear increase of
      <i>"manually"</i>, maximum 100 %,
    </li>
    <li>
      diameter.q</i> ‚â• 40 cm: 100 % <i>"manually"</i>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  

<h4><i>price.ref.assortment</i></h4>

Wood price of the reference assortments allowing for the consideration
of market fluctuations as described above. Default is <i>"baseline"</i>,
which refers to the prices from 2010 to 2015 in Hesse, Germany according

<h2><em><a name="fct_harvest_costs">harvest_costs()</a></em></h2>

The function estimates harvest costs per unit skidded volume
[EUR m<sup>-3</sup>] applying the harvest costs function of
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Consequences of
calamities are implemented based on [Dieter (2001)](#dieter.2001),
[Moellmann and Moehring (2017)](#moellmann.2017),
[Fuchs et al. (2021)](#fuchs.2021), and
[Fuchs et al. (under review)](#fuchs.underreview).

<h3>Data and Model</h3>

The diameter- and species-sensitive harvest cost model was developed by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). It is based on data
from [KWF (2006)](#kwf.2006) and [AFL (2014)](#afl.2014). The fitted
model function is:

<p align="center">
  <i>c</i> = max(<i>$\alpha$</i> \*
  <i>d<sub>q</sub></i><sup><i>$\beta$</i></sup> + <i>$\gamma$</i>,
  <i>c<sub>max</sub></i>),
</p>

with the quadratic mean diameter <i>d<sub>q</sub></i> and the parameters
<i>$\alpha$</i> to <i>$\gamma$</i> and the maximum costs
<i>c<sub>max</sub></i>. The harvest costs were derived for a smaller
number of economic species groups, thus, the species assignments differ
from those for
<a href="#fct_wood_revenues"><em>wood_revenues()</em></a>. The species
assignments are provided by:

``` r
get_species_codes()
```

The harvest costs are calculated under the assumption of combinations of
harvest processes, depended on the quadratic mean of the tree diameters
as well as the accessibility of the stand. The accessibility is
considered in three cost levels (see <a href="#tab4">Tab. 4</a>). To
avoid unusually high harvest costs at smaller diameters,

A special strength of <strong>woodValuationDE</strong> is the
consideration of consequences of disturbances and large-scale
calamities. A broad set of previously published and newly derived
quantitative effects of calamities is implemented. Additionally, users
can implement their own assumptions. For the harvest costs,
multiplicative factors as well as absolute summands can be used for
implementing consequences of disturbances. The options that are
implemented by default are listed in <a href="#tab5">Tab. 5</a>.

<h2><em><a name="fct_wood_valuation">wood_valuation()</a></em></h2>

The function is a wrapper for the entire procedure of wood valuation
implemented in <strong>woodValuationDE</strong>. It estimates the share
of salable (for revenues) and skidded (for harvest costs) volume as well
as the wood revenues and harvest costs per unit volume. Finally, it
derives the net revenues for the user-provided volume referring to the
volume over bark of the standing trees to be harvested.

<h3>Data and Model</h3>

The function applies the previously described models implemented in the
functions <a href="#fct_vol_salable"><i>vol_salable()</i></a>,
<a href="#fct_vol_skidded"><i>vol_skidded()</i></a>,
<a href="#fct_wood_revenues"><i>wood_revenues()</i></a>, and
<a href="#fct_harvest_costs"><i>harvest_costs()</i></a>.

<h3>Input</h3>

<h4><i>volume</i></h4>

Wood volume [m<sup>3</sup>], referring to volume over bark of the
standing trees to be harvested (German unit Vfm) as usually provided by
yield tables and single-tree simulation models.

<h4><i>diameter.q</i></h4>

The quadratic mean<sup>[3](#fndq)</sup> of the diameter at breast height
(dbh) of the harvested trees [cm].

<h4><i>species</i></h4>

The tree species, using one of the available <i>species.code.type</i>s.
<a href="#tab1">Tab. 1</a> lists the most important genera and species
implemented. Most species are assigned to economic species groups for
the valuation. A list of available species codes, and their assignments
to valuation groups is provided by:

``` r
get_species_codes()
```

<h4><i>value.level</i></h4>

Stand quality, expressed as integer value of 1:3:
      
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>1</i>: extraordinary high stand quality with high shares of wood
    suitable for furniture
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>2</i>: average quality
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>3</i>: extraordinary low quality (e.g. trees with many thick
    branches)
  </li>
</ul>
      
The <i>value.levels</i> refer to the applied assortment tables
[(Offer and Staupendahl, 2018)](#offer.2018).

<h4><i>cost.level</i></h4>

Accessibility of the stand for harvest operations expressed as integer
of 1:3, with 1 for standard conditions without limitations, 2 for moist
sites or sites with a slope between 36 % and 58 %, and 3 for slopes \>
58 %. The cost.levels refer to the harvest cost model by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018, Tab. 10)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). See also
<a href="#tab4">Tab. 4</a>

<h4><i>process.type</i></h4>

Type of harvest process:
        
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>"manually"</i>: motor-manual harvest using a chain saw
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"harvester"</i>: highly mechanized harvest machines
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"combined"</i>: a combination of the previous types dependent on
    the mean diameter.
  </li>
</ul>
        
The process types <i>"manually"</i> and <i>"harvester"</i> refer to
[Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Since e.g. for
deciduous species a maximum diameter of 40 cm is assumed for highly
mechanized harvests,
[Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation) derived the type
<i>"combined"</i>. This refers to the combinations applied by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018) in the harvest cost
model, assuming diameter-specific shares of motor-manual and highly
mechanized harvests:
                
<ul>
  <li>
    softwood species
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>diameter.q</i> ‚â§ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,
    </li>
    <li>
      20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 50 cm: linear increase of
      <i>"manually"</i>, maximum 50 %,

    </li>
    <li>
      20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 40 cm: linear increase of
      <i>"manually"</i>, maximum 100 %,
    </li>
    <li>
      diameter.q</i> ‚â• 40 cm: 100 % <i>"manually"</i>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4><i>price.ref.assortment</i></h4>

Wood price of the reference assortments allowing for the consideration
of market fluctuations. Default is <i>"baseline"</i>,
which refers to the prices from 2010 to 2015 in Hesse, Germany according
to [von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018), listed in
<a href="#tab2">Tab. 2</a>. Alternatively, users can provide a
tibble with the same structure, which is illustrated by the
<i>"baseline"</i> tibble:

``` r

```

<h4><i>calamity.type</i></h4>

Type of calamity or disturbance event in case of salvage harvests. This
determines the applied reductions for salvage revenues. For the
implemented options, see <a href="#tab3">Tab.3</a>. Alternatively, users
can provide their own factors.

<h4><i>calamity.factors</i></h4>

Summands [EUR m<sup>-3</sup>] and factors to consider the consequences
of disturbances and calamities on wood revenues and harvest costs.
<i>"baseline"</i> provides a tibble based on the references listed in

<h2><em><a name="fct_wood_net_revenues">wood_net_revenues()</a></em></h2>

The function is a wrapper for the wood valuation provided by
<strong>woodValuationDE</strong>. It calls
<a href="#fct_wood_valuation"><em>wood_valuation()</em></a> and returns
only the net revenues for the user-provided volume referring to the
volume over bark of the standing trees to be harvested.

<h3>Data and Model</h3>

The function applies the previously described models implemented in the
functions <a href="#fct_vol_salable"><i>vol_salable()</i></a>,
<a href="#fct_vol_skidded"><i>vol_skidded()</i></a>,
<a href="#fct_wood_revenues"><i>wood_revenues()</i></a>, and
<a href="#fct_harvest_costs"><i>harvest_costs()</i></a>.

<h3>Input</h3>

<h4><i>volume</i></h4>

Wood volume [m<sup>3</sup>], referring to volume over bark of the
standing trees to be harvested (German unit Vfm) as usually provided by
yield tables and single-tree simulation models.

<h4><i>diameter.q</i></h4>

The quadratic mean<sup>[3](#fndq)</sup> of the diameter at breast height
(dbh) of the harvested trees [cm].

<h4><i>species</i></h4>

The tree species, using one of the available <i>species.code.type</i>s.
<a href="#tab1">Tab. 1</a> lists the most important genera and species
implemented. Most species are assigned to economic species groups for
the valuation. A list of available species codes, and their assignments
to valuation groups is provided by:

``` r
get_species_codes()
```

<h4><i>value.level</i></h4>

Stand quality, expressed as integer value of 1:3:
    
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>1</i>: extraordinary high stand quality with high shares of wood
    suitable for furniture
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>2</i>: average quality
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>3</i>: extraordinary low quality (e.g. trees with many thick
    branches)
  </li>
</ul>
      
The <i>value.levels</i> refer to the applied assortment tables
[(Offer and Staupendahl, 2018)](#offer.2018).

<h4><i>cost.level</i></h4>

Accessibility of the stand for harvest operations expressed as integer
of 1:3, with 1 for standard conditions without limitations, 2 for moist
sites or sites with a slope between 36 % and 58 %, and 3 for slopes \>
58 %. The cost.levels refer to the harvest cost model by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018, Tab. 10)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). See also
<a href="#tab4">Tab. 4</a>

<h4><i>process.type</i></h4>

Type of harvest process:
        
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>"manually"</i>: motor-manual harvest using a chain saw
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"harvester"</i>: highly mechanized harvest machines
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>"combined"</i>: a combination of the previous types dependent on
    the mean diameter.
  </li>
</ul>

The process types <i>"manually"</i> and <i>"harvester"</i> refer to
[Offer and Staupendahl (2018)](#offer.2018) and
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018). Since e.g. for
deciduous species a maximum diameter of 40 cm is assumed for highly
mechanized harvests,
[Fuchs et al. (in preparation)](#fuchs.inpreparation) derived the type
<i>"combined"</i>. This refers to the combinations applied by
[von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018) in the harvest cost
model, assuming diameter-specific shares of motor-manual and highly
mechanized harvests:
              
<ul>
  <li>
    softwood species
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>diameter.q</i> ‚â§ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,
    </li>
    <li>
      20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 50 cm: linear increase of
      <i>"manually"</i>, maximum 50 %,
    </li>
    <li>
      diameter.q</i> ‚â• 50 cm: 50 % <i>"harvester"</i> and 50 %
      <i>"manually"</i>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    deciduous species
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>diameter.q</i> ‚â§ 20 cm: 100 % <i>"harvester"</i>,
    </li>
    <li>
      20 cm \< <i>diameter.q</i> \< 40 cm: linear increase of
      <i>"manually"</i>, maximum 100 %,
    </li>
    <li>
      diameter.q</i> ‚â• 40 cm: 100 % <i>"manually"</i>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4><i>price.ref.assortment</i></h4>

Wood price of the reference assortments allowing for the consideration
of market fluctuations. Default is <i>"baseline"</i>,
which refers to the prices from 2010 to 2015 in Hesse, Germany according
to [von Bodelschwingh (2018)](#vonbodelschwingh.2018), listed in
<a href="#tab2">Tab. 2</a>. Alternatively, users can provide a
tibble with the same structure, which is illustrated by the
<i>"baseline"</i> tibble:

``` r
prices.ref.assortments <- dplyr::tibble(
      species = c(110, 211, 511, 711, 611,
                  811, 410, 421, 311, 430),
      price.ref.assortment = c(277.41, 75.75, 92.47, 71.48, 92.23,

```

<h4><i>calamity.type</i></h4>

Type of calamity or disturbance event in case of salvage harvests. This
determines the applied reductions for salvage revenues. For the
implemented options, see <a href="#tab3">Tab.3</a>. Alternatively, users
can provide their own factors.

<h4><i>calamity.factors</i></h4>

Summands [EUR m<sup>-3</sup>] and factors to consider the consequences
of disturbances and calamities on wood revenues and harvest costs.
<i>"baseline"</i> provides a tibble based on the references listed in
