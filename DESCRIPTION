Description: A package for the monetary valuation of wood in German forests,
             including estimations of harvest volume proportions, wood revenues
             and harvest costs. The functions are sensitive to tree species,
             mean diameter of the harvested trees, stand quality and harvest
             procedure. The functions include estimations for the consequences
             of disturbances on revenues and costs.
             The underlying assortment tables are taken from Offer and
             Staupendahl (2018) with corresponding functions for salable and
             skidded volume derived in Fuchs et al. (in preparation). Wood 
             revenue and harvest cost functions were taken from von
             Bodelschwingh (2018). The consequences of disturbances refer to
             Dieter (2001), Moellmann and Moehring (2017) and Fuchs et al.
             (2022a, 2022b). For the full references see
             documentation of functions and package readme. Apart from Dieter
             (2001) and Moellmann and Moehring (2017), all functions and factors
             are based on operational data of HessenForst, the forest
             administration of the Federal State of Hesse in Germany.
