Description: Monetary valutation of standing wood with assortment, wood revenue,
             and harvest costs functions sensitive to tree species, tree
             diameter, wood quality, harvest procedure, and calamities. The 
             underlying assortment tables are taken from Offer and Staupendahl
             (2018) with corresponding functions for salable and skidded volume
             derived in Fuchs et al. (in preparation). Wood revenue and
             harvest cost functions were taken from von Bodelschwingh (2018).
             The effects of calamities refer to Dieter (2001), Fuchs et al.
             (under review), and Fuchs et al. (in preparation). For the full
             references see documentation of functions and package readme.
             Apart from Dieter (2001), all functions and factors are based on 
             operational data of HessenForst, the forest administration of the
             Federal State of Hesse in Germany.
